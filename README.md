ðŸ”­ Currently Working on:
  - Bachelors and Masters degrees in Software Engineering
  - Learning Embedded C and Web Accesibility
  - Unnamed game project in Godot 4.0
  - Tracking how many people are in a room with random left over IR sensors

âœ¨ Perpetually tinkering in Python, Java, and mathematical languages like Matlab and Mathematica.
ðŸŒ± Looking for an excuse to learn Ocaml, Rust, Zig, COBOL, Haskell, among others...

Super excited about education and programming.

I'll come back to yap about my masters thesis when I'm actually working on it. ðŸ˜…
